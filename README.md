Nex is a programming language written in scala and jython.

Nex hopes to introduce new and useful paradigms to programmers and encourage them to use these paradigms to solve problems easier and faster. Nex is inspired by scala, lambda prolog, prolog, and answer set prolog. Nex also introduces several completely new concepts including what we call attribute declaration, bonded types, attribute literal, Strict Answer sets, and a revolutionary time function taking advantage of strict answer sets. Nex is designed to be a general purpose but benefits strongly from libraries and frameworks by taking advantage of an easy import system.
